## Non-functional Requirements

1. **Performance**:
    - *Explanation*: The application should quickly return search results and manage user inputs without delay.
    - *Implementation*: Implement database indexing and optimize SQL queries to speed up the search for restaurants based on location, cuisine type, and other filters.

2. **Portability**:
    - *Explanation*: The application should be able to run on different operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux) without needing significant changes to the codebase.
    - *Implementation*: Since the application is written in Java, it will leverage Java's "write once, run anywhere" (WORA) principle. The application will be built into an executable JAR 
file to be easily executed on any system that has the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed.

3. **Usability**:
    - *Explanation*: The interface should be intuitive and user-friendly, enabling users to quickly navigate the app.
    - *Implementation*: Create a clean, minimalist design with helpful tooltips, responsive error handling, and user feedback mechanisms.
