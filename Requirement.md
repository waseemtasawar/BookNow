## Functional Requirements

### **Use Case 1: User Authentication**
- **Actors**: New User, Existing User
- **Use case goal**: Allow users to create new accounts and log in to access the application.

  - User enters their username and password.
  - System validates the credentials and logs the user in.
- **Alternative flows**:
  - **Alternative flow 1**: User enters mismatched passwords when creating an account.
